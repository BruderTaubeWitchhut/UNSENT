# UNSENT

UNSENT is a gentle digital space where people write the messages they *never send.* It provides a private, reflective experience that helps users understand emotional patterns, find meaning in their feelings, and connect silently with others who have felt something similar.

UNSENT prioritizes emotional privacy, agency, and thoughtful technology — offering optional, person-centered support without intrusive alerts or assumptions.

## Features
- **Unsent Letter Interface:** A calm, private space to write thoughts you don’t share.
- **Emotional Theme Reflection:** The app identifies emotional patterns from your writing and presents them in neutral, empathetic language.
- **Support Choices:** Users can choose whether they want calming guidance or deeper insight, or simply sit with their feelings.
- **PeerBridge:** Optionally view anonymous unsent messages from others who have felt similar themes, without likes or comments.
- **Ethical Safety Panel:** Quietly accessible crisis support resources, always optional and non-intrusive.

## Tech Highlights
UNSENT combines natural language pattern analysis, user-led interaction design, and a calm minimalist UI to create a unique, supportive experience.
